Many of the 1500 families who come to us every year are not in a financial position to pay for the services we offer. To stay true to our mantra; ‘no child unseen, no child unheard’, we have launched the Cheer for Children (CFC) Fund. This fund enables children to avail our many services, from initial assessment to ongoing therapies as well as workshops and professional services for parents and older children.

In order to make our services sustainable, Sethu charges nominal fees for families attending our current centre. Approximately 18% of our children who attend come from families who are unable to pay the fees, which are of course, necessary to pay for the running expenses of the Centre. While we are providing free care for these children, we need support from philanthropic individuals to make our services more accessible to poorer families.

By contributing to the CFC fund, you would be directly helping to ensure that all children receive the help they need. How you can help… Sponsorship for a child is easy! By donating a minimum of INR 600 you become ‘A Sethu Star’. A donation as small as this goes towards the running costs of a single session. Larger donations can take care of a child’s therapy for a month or ideally for a year.
