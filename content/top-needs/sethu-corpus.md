Our corpus ensures that we will always be around - whatever the eventuality.In recent history, as covid struck our doors, like many others were forced to close and our services stopped. The outgoings for running our centre and our projects did not. The Sethu corpus is our very important security blanket.Our children and their families and the family that is Sethu need to be here always to ensure that, 'no child is unseen and no child is unheard'.
