Our corpus ensures that we will always be around &mdash; whatever the eventuality. When Covid struck our doors, like many others, we were forced to close and stop services. The outgoings for running our centre and our projects did not. The Sethu corpus is our very important security blanket. For our children and their families, the Sethu family needs to be here, always to ensure that, **_'no child is unseen and no child is unheard'_**.
