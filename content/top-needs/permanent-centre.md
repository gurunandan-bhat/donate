Our permanent centre in Guirim, North Goa, built to inclusive, universal design standards will exemplify an impossible dream brought to fruition by ordinary people who believe that Goaâ€™s children deserve better. Construction has been in full swing since April last year. We expect to have the grey structure completed by December 2024, and be ready for the big reveal by the end of 2025. Please join our mission, donate generously and help us walk the rest of the way home.
