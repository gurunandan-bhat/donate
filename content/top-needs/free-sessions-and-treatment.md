Sethu charges a nominal fee for its services. Sadly, about 20% of our families are unable to pay. For the children of these families, we deliver services and support free of charge. We welcome support from philanthropic individuals in order to make our services more accessible to poorer families. We launched the Cheer for Children fund (CFC). This fund enables children to avail of any service from, initial assessment to ongoing therapies as well as workshops and services for parents and older children.
